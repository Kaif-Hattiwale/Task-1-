🛡️ Network Scanning & Enumeration — Task 1
This project demonstrates the use of Nmap for scanning a local network, identifying active hosts, enumerating open ports, and researching common services and their potential security implications.

📌 Objectives :
Identify active hosts in a local subnet
Scan for open TCP ports on a specific host
Perform version detection on open ports
Analyze common services and assess potential vulnerabilities
Document the findings for evaluation

🔧 Tools Used
nmap (Network Mapper)
Wireshark (for traffic analysis and validation)

📝 Report Contents
List of detected open ports
Identified services with versions
Potential impact for each exposed service
Security concerns (e.g., DDoS, lateral movement, outdated software)
Suggested next steps (e.g., restrict exposure, disable unused services)

✅ Conclusion
This task forms the foundation of penetration testing and system hardening by learning how to:
Enumerate systems
Understand exposed services
Evaluate risk based on service fingerprints.
